# Predict_the_price
Prediction of house prices based on different features - experimenting with different optimization algorithms, feature combinations and cost functions.

#### Instructions :

1. Along with each source code there is a corresponding folder containing it's results.
2. Each folder contains a `.csv` of final predicted values,a text document containing learnt parameters & RMSE values, & .`png` of the plots.
3. The report too contains the learnt parameters & RMSE values along with required justifications.
4. To run each source code file, use the `.csv` file provided along in this folder or convert the data set that has been given in the assignment to a `.csv` file first.
5. Change the path to required path in the system being used.
6. Run the python file.
7. If specific values are required to be seen , like error and theta at every iteration, please uncomment the corresponding print statements in the file.
8. The output generated are plots showing the RMSE vs. learning rate trends for each experiment.
